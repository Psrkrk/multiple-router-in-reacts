React Routing Project
This project demonstrates the use of React Router for navigating between multiple pages like Home, About, GitHub, and Contact using react-router-dom (v6.26.1). It is built using React 18.3.1.
This React project showcases routing using react-router-dom to switch between different views without reloading the page. It includes a simple navigation bar to allow users to visit the following pages:

Home
About
GitHub
Contact

Features
React Router v6.26.1: Enables client-side routing.
React 18.3.1: The latest version of React for building the UI.
Modular Components: Each route (page) is represented as a separate component for better code organization.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

bash

│   ├── GitHub.jsx      # GitHub page component
│   └── Contact.jsx     # Contact page component
└── App.jsx             # Main application component that includes routing logic
Page Components
Each page is defined as its own React component within the components/ directory. These pages will be rendered based on the route the user navigates to.
